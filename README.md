# MedellinMetroAlert
This is a go project that tracks the activity of [@metrodemedellin](https://twitter.com/metrodemedellin) so that the user can keep track of the mobility regarding Medellin's city metro system.
Only tweets regarding alerts of mobility are displayed and they are also filtered by the actual date because older alerts are considered not to be useful
